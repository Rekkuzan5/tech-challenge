## Technologies Used

This application was created using Next.js, and css, no bootstrap.

## Getting Started

This is the Tech-Challenge for Midwestern-Interactive, challenges #1 & #2.

## How it Works - Home Page

The Home page displays three cards that will FETCH data from the MWI api and outputs that data into the data fields in each card section.  The bottom of the Home page has a clickable link that will display a list of unique names in an unordered list from two objects inside the codebase.

## How it Works - Contact Page

The Contact page displays a Heading on the left and a Form input on the right.  The form will take the text from the input fields and create a POST that will create a submission to the MWI api.
